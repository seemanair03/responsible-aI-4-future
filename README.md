AI for Sustainability &amp; Ethical Knowledge Retrieval

# 📌 Project Overview
With growing environmental concerns and misinformation challenges, this AI system aims to:
- 🌱 Enhance sustainability by optimizing natural resource usage and predicting ecological trends.
- 🔍 Ensure ethical knowledge retrieval through AI-powered misinformation filtering and fact validation.
- 🧠 Educate the next generation using AI-driven critical thinking tools.

# 🚀 Key Features
- 🌍 AI-Driven Resource Optimization: Tracks climate trends, biodiversity, and pollution using deep learning models.
- ✅ Ethical Information Retrieval: Filters misinformation using transformer-based NLP (BERT, GPT, RAG).
- 🔬 Predictive AI Analytics: Forecasts future resource shortages and sustainability risks.
- 📖 Explainable AI: Provides transparency and bias mitigation in ethical AI decision-making.

# 🔧 Technologies Used
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): BERT, GPT, RAG for ethical search.
- Computer Vision: YOLO, Mask R-CNN for biodiversity tracking.
- Time-Series Forecasting: LSTMs, ARIMA for climate predictions.
- Explainable AI (XAI): Ensures ethical and fair AI responses.
